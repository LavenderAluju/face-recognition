<h>OpenCV &amp; python</h>
OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. 
Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. 
The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license

<h>SQLite Database</h>
SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. 
In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. 
Rather, it is embedded into the end program.

In this project we use opencv to identify and relate found human faces to ones stored in SQLite Database.
Details of the found is to be shown below the rectangle bound face.
If a new face is found, the  user is enrolled to the system.
